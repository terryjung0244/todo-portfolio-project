# React Todo App

Welcome to the React Todo App! This simple yet powerful task management application is built using React, providing an intuitive and efficient way to organize your daily tasks.

## Backend Repository

[Backend Repository](https://github.com/terryjung0244/todo-portfolio-project-backend)

## Features

- **Create:** Add new tasks with a title and description to keep track of your to-do list.
- **Read:** View a list of all your tasks along with their details.
- **Update:** Edit task titles and descriptions to keep information up-to-date.
- **Delete:** Remove completed or unnecessary tasks with the delete functionality.
- **Complete:** Mark tasks as completed for better task management.

## Technologies Used

Frontend

- **React:** Utilized for building a modular and dynamic user interface.
- **Redux:** With Redux, state is stored globally and ensuring a centralized and predictable data flow in the application, enhancing scalability and maintainbility.
- **Styled-Component:** Styled for a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
  **typescript** Enabling early error detection, improved code quality, and enhanced developer productivity through better code.
- **testing** Made sure the app works well by doing thorough testing with tools like Jest and React Testing Library. Checked different parts of the code, from small pieces to the whole app, to make sure everything is stable and reliable

Backend

- **node.js** Node.js is a platform that allows JavaScript to be used for server-side programming, making it possible to build scalable and efficient web applications.
- **express** Express is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building robust and scalable web applications by providing a set of features and tools.
- **mongodb** MongoDB is a database management system that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It is known for its scalability and flexibility, making it well-suited for handling large amounts of data in modern applications.

## Project Structure

- **Components:** Organized into modular components for better code organization and reusability.
- **State Management:** Utilized React state for efficient data handling and updates.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-todo-app.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd todo-portfolio-app`
3. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
4. Run the development server: `yarn start`

## Challenges and Learnings

1. The project is build using the React Library, allowing for the creation of reusable components and redux as global state.

2. I faced some challenges during this project, such as handling state, managing component interactions, and implementing CRUD operations efficiently by redux. However, through research, trial and error, and practice, I was able to overcome these challenges and gain valuable experience in React development.

3. I experienced how important the advantages of testing is. It can be early bug detection to catch and fix bugs before the actual reach production. Testing code is more maintainable and easier to understand for future improvements.
