## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-todo-app.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd todo-portfolio-app`
3. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
4. Run the development server: `yarn start`

## Challenges and Learnings

1. The project is build using the React Library, allowing for the creation of reusable components and redux as global state.

2. I faced some challenges during this project, such as handling state, managing component interactions, and implementing CRUD operations efficiently by redux. However, through research, trial and error, and practice, I was able to overcome these challenges and gain valuable experience in React development.

3. I experienced how important the advantages of testing is. It can be early bug detection to catch and fix bugs before the actual reach production. Testing code is more maintainable and easier to understand for future improvements.
